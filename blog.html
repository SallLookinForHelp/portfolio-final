        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>
            Here you can explore the work I’ve done in networking, systems, and infrastructure.
            Each project reflects my hands-on experience and problem-solving in real environments.

            <h2>Switch Replacements</h2>
            <p>
                Early in my career at Michigan State University, I had the opportunity to be apart of the team that replaced over 800 end-of-life network switches across campus. This project was mainly focused on improving network performance and reliability for students that lived in residence halls. My role in this project was to plan, install, replace and configure switches in multiple residence halls across campus. This project allowed me to gain hands-on experience with network hardware, configuration, and troubleshooting in a real-world environment.

            <h2>Troubleshooting and Planning</h2>
            <p>
                In my current role, I have been actively involved in troubleshooting network issues and planning for network upgrades. This includes diagnosing connectivity problems, analyzing network performance, and collaborating with senior engineers to develop solutions. Throughout this process, I have learned several subtle but important aspects of network management, such as the importance of cable managment, particularly when it comes to patch cables. Proper cable management not only improves the aesthetics of network closets but also enhances airflow, reduces the risk of cable damage, and simplifies maintenance tasks.

            <h2>Nightmare Closets</h2>
            <p>
            Michigan State is no stranger to older infrastructure, and as a result, we often encounter network closets that are in dire need of organization and cleanup. I have been part of several initiatives to revamp these "nightmare closets," which involved sorting through tangled cables, labeling equipment, and reorganizing hardware for better accessibility. This ticket I responded to ended up testing me in ways I hadn't expected, as the building was in dire need of new cables and switches. After coordinating with my team, we were able to replace outdated equipment and implement a more structured layout, with proper cables however this process took several hours of work. The experience taught me the value of patience, teamwork, and reminded me of how unpredictable networking work can be.
