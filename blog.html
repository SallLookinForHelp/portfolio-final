            <h2>Switch Replacements</h2>
            <p>
                Early in my career at Michigan State University, I had the opportunity to be a part of the team that replaced over 800 end-of-life network switches across campus. This project focused on improving performance and reliability for residence halls. I assisted with planning, installing, replacing, and configuring network switches across multiple buildings.

            <h2>Troubleshooting and Planning</h2>
            <p>
                In my current role, I have been heavily involved in troubleshooting network issues and preparing for network upgrades. This includes diagnosing connectivity problems, analyzing performance, and working with senior engineers to implement improvements.

            <h2>Nightmare Closets</h2>
            <p>
                Michigan State has many older buildings, which often means outdated network closets. I have helped revamp several closets in poor condition by organizing cables, labeling equipment, and replacing failing hardware. One ticket in particular required new cabling and new switches due to the building’s age.
